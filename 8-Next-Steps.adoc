[[Next Steps]]
== Next Steps

What are the next steps? didn't I learned enough?

=== Step 1: Plugins

- Even if this jenkins instance has tones of plugins installed by default for sure you will come across times when you need others
- Plugins url -> https://plugins.jenkins.io/


=== Step 2: Pipeline

- We only scratch the surface of `Pipeline`
- Pipeline ulr -> https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/

=== Step 3: Jobs

- As you seen we created a job manually only the pipeline part was automated
- Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/jenkins-from-zero-to-hero/

*This is it - Thanks!*
