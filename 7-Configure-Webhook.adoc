== Configure Webhook

In this Lab we will create a webhook.

=== Step 1: Webhook?

- In order to notify Jenkins that you or your colleagues have made some code change we need to add a notification url within our project

*Note:* for this demo we will use GitHub but all webhooks will configure the same regardless that you are using bitbucket or anything else.


=== Step 2: Open GitHub

- Select your desired project
- Select `Settings` -> `Webhooks`
- Just add the url that is `http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/`

- For the other stuff we already configured the pipeline to know about our webhook.
- Feel free to make a push in your repo and notice that jenkins will trigger a new build.

*Congrats you have a project that is automated!*
